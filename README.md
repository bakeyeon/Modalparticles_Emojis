Abstract:
This study investigates the use of emoticons for translating the emotional connotations conveyed by German modal particles into other languages. German modal particles play a crucial role in adding subtlety and expressive emojis to speech, posing challenges for non-German speakers in grasping nuanced meanings. The research aims to facilitate intercultural communication and advance multilingual translation by exploring the capacity of emojis to capture the emotional nuances inherent in modal particles. Through a survey involving proficient speakers of German and Korean, significant similarities were observed between the emotional scores associated with modal particles and expressive emojis. These findings underscore the potential of emojis in preserving emotional expressions across diverse linguistic contexts.
